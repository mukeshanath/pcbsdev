                            When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collection of data and using it for that specific reason only.
                            If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
                            How to withdraw your consent?
                            After you have given the consent, if you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent given to us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by sending email to us at pcbs@pcnl.in.

                            <p class="para">
                            In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
                            However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
                            For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
                            In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
                            Once you leave our website or redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.
